## RHEL 9.1 to 10.x Procedure

### Method: Using init=/bin/bash

This method boots directly into a bash shell, bypassing the normal systemd initialization process.

#### Step 1: Initiate System Reboot
```bash
# If you have any access to the system, initiate a clean reboot
sudo reboot
```
**OR** perform a hard restart using physical power controls if necessary.

#### Step 2: Interrupt the Boot Process
1. **Watch the boot screen** for the GRUB boot loader
2. **Stop the countdown timer** by pressing the **Up** or **Down** arrow keys
3. The system will pause at the GRUB menu

#### Step 3: Edit the Boot Entry
1. **Select the kernel** to edit (usually the first entry in the list)
2. **Press the 'e' key** to enter edit mode
3. You will see the kernel boot parameters

#### Step 4: Modify Boot Parameters
1. **Locate the line** that begins with `linux`
2. **Remove** any `console` and/or `vconsole` directives from this line
   ```
   # Before (example):
   linux /vmlinuz-5.14.0 root=/dev/mapper/rhel-root console=tty0 vconsole.keymap=us
   
   # After:
   linux /vmlinuz-5.14.0 root=/dev/mapper/rhel-root
   ```
3. **Add `init=/bin/bash`** to the end of the line (ensure there's a space before it)
   ```
   # Final line should look like:
   linux /vmlinuz-5.14.0 root=/dev/mapper/rhel-root init=/bin/bash
   ```

#### Step 5: Boot with Modified Parameters
1. **Press Ctrl+X** to boot with the modified parameters
2. The system will boot directly into a bash shell

#### Step 6: Remount Root Filesystem as Read-Write
```bash
# At the bash-5.1# prompt, enter:
mount -o remount,rw /
```
**Purpose**: The root filesystem is initially mounted as read-only. This command makes it writable so you can modify the password file.

#### Step 7: Reset the Root Password
```bash
# Enter the passwd command
passwd

# You will be prompted to enter a new password twice:
New password: [enter your new password]
Retype new password: [confirm your new password]
```

#### Step 8: Create SELinux Relabel Flag
```bash
# CRITICAL: Run this command exactly as shown
touch /.autorelabel
```
**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Be extremely careful with this command. A typo could cause system damage.

**Purpose**: This creates a flag file that tells SELinux to relabel all files on the next boot, ensuring proper security contexts.

#### Step 9: Reboot the System
```bash
# Force an immediate reboot
/usr/sbin/reboot -f
```

#### Step 10: Complete the Process
1. **Wait for reboot** - The system may reboot multiple times during the SELinux relabeling process
2. **Be patient** - The first boot after relabeling can take several minutes
3. **Log in** with your new root password once the system is fully booted

## RHEL 7 to 9.0 Procedure

### Method: Using rd.break

This method interrupts the boot process at the initramfs stage, providing access to modify the system.

#### Step 1: Initiate System Reboot
```bash
# If you have any access to the system, initiate a clean reboot
sudo reboot
```
**OR** perform a hard restart using physical power controls if necessary.

#### Step 2: Interrupt the Boot Process
1. **Watch the boot screen** for the GRUB boot loader
2. **Stop the countdown timer** by pressing the **Up** or **Down** arrow keys
3. The system will pause at the GRUB menu

#### Step 3: Select and Edit Boot Entry
1. **Use arrow keys** to navigate and select the kernel to edit (usually the first entry)
2. **Press the 'e' key** to enter edit mode
3. You will see the kernel boot parameters

#### Step 4: Modify Boot Parameters
1. **Locate the line** that begins with `linux`
2. **Remove** any `console` and/or `vconsole` directives from this line
   ```
   # Before (example):
   linux16 /vmlinuz-3.10.0 root=/dev/mapper/rhel-root console=tty0 vconsole.keymap=us
   
   # After:
   linux16 /vmlinuz-3.10.0 root=/dev/mapper/rhel-root
   ```
3. **Add `rd.break`** to the end of the line (ensure there's a space before it)
   ```
   # Final line should look like:
   linux16 /vmlinuz-3.10.0 root=/dev/mapper/rhel-root rd.break
   ```

#### Step 5: Boot with Modified Parameters
1. **Press Ctrl+X** to boot with the modified parameters
2. The system will drop into an emergency shell at the initramfs stage

#### Step 6: Remount the System Root
```bash
# At the switch_root:/# prompt, run:
mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
```
**Purpose**: This mounts the actual system root filesystem in read-write mode under /sysroot.

#### Step 7: Change Root to System Root
```bash
# Change into the system root environment
chroot /sysroot
```
**Purpose**: This makes /sysroot the new root directory, giving you access to the full system environment.

#### Step 8: Reset the Root Password
```bash
# At the sh-4.4# prompt (version number may differ), enter:
passwd

# You will be prompted to enter a new password twice:
New password: [enter your new password]
Retype new password: [confirm your new password]
```

#### Step 9: Create SELinux Relabel Flag
```bash
# CRITICAL: Run this command exactly as shown
touch /.autorelabel
```
**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Be extremely careful with this command. A typo could cause system damage.

#### Step 10: Exit and Reboot
```bash
# Type 'exit' twice to return to normal boot process
exit
exit
```

#### Step 11: Complete the Process
1. **Wait for reboot** - The system may reboot multiple times during the SELinux relabeling process
2. **Be patient** - The first boot after relabeling can take several minutes
3. **Log in** with your new root password once the system is fully booted

## Important Notes and Warnings

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warnings

1. **Physical Access Required**: These procedures require physical or console access to the system
2. **SELinux Relabeling**: The `touch /.autorelabel` command is crucial - without it, you may not be able to log in
3. **Typo Prevention**: Be extremely careful when typing commands, especially the autorelabel command
4. **Multiple Reboots**: The system may reboot several times during the SELinux relabeling process
5. **Time Consumption**: The relabeling process can take a significant amount of time on large filesystems

### üîç Key Differences Between Versions

| Aspect | RHEL 7-9.0 | RHEL 9.1-10.x |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Boot Parameter** | `rd.break` | `init=/bin/bash` |
| **Initial Prompt** | `switch_root:/#` | `bash-5.1#` |
| **Root Remount** | `mount -o remount,rw /sysroot` | `mount -o remount,rw /` |
| **Chroot Required** | Yes (`chroot /sysroot`) | No |
| **Exit Method** | `exit` twice | `/usr/sbin/reboot -f` |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Cannot Edit GRUB Menu
**Symptoms**: Unable to access GRUB edit mode
**Solutions**:
- Try pressing 'e' multiple times during boot
- Ensure you're stopping the countdown timer first
- Check if system has UEFI Secure Boot enabled (may require different approach)

#### Issue: SELinux Relabeling Takes Too Long
**Symptoms**: System appears to hang during boot after password reset
**Solutions**:
- Be patient - relabeling can take 30+ minutes on large systems
- If system truly hangs, boot with `selinux=0` temporarily and run `fixfiles relabel` manually

#### Issue: "Authentication token manipulation error"
**Symptoms**: Password change fails
**Solutions**:
- Ensure root filesystem is mounted read-write
- Check disk space availability
- Verify /etc directory permissions

#### Issue: System Boots to Emergency Mode
**Symptoms**: After following procedure, system boots to emergency shell
**Solutions**:
- Check `/var/log/messages` for clues
- Verify filesystem integrity with `fsck`
- Ensure proper SELinux contexts with `restorecon -R /`

## Security Considerations

### üîí Security Implications

1. **Physical Security**: These procedures highlight the importance of physical security
2. **Boot Security**: Consider implementing GRUB password protection
3. **Audit Trail**: Password resets may not be logged in standard audit logs
4. **Policy Compliance**: Ensure this procedure aligns with organizational security policies

### üõ°Ô∏è Preventive Measures

1. **Multiple Admin Accounts**: Maintain multiple administrative accounts
2. **SSH Key Authentication**: Use SSH keys instead of passwords where possible
3. **Centralized Authentication**: Implement LDAP/Active Directory integration
4. **Documentation**: Maintain secure documentation of emergency procedures
5. **Regular Testing**: Test recovery procedures in development environments

### üìù Post-Recovery Actions

1. **Change Password Again**: Consider changing the password again from a normal session
2. **Review Logs**: Check system logs for any issues during the recovery process
3. **Update Documentation**: Document when and why the recovery was performed
4. **Security Review**: Review why the password was lost and implement preventive measures

## Summary

This guide provides comprehensive procedures for recovering root access on RHEL systems. The key difference between RHEL versions is the boot interruption method:

- **RHEL 9.1+**: Use `init=/bin/bash` for direct shell access
- **RHEL 7-9.0**: Use `rd.break` for initramfs interruption

Remember that both procedures require the critical `touch /.autorelabel` step to ensure proper SELinux operation after password reset.

### Quick Reference Commands

**RHEL 9.1+**:
```bash
# Boot parameter: init=/bin/bash
mount -o remount,rw /
passwd
touch /.autorelabel
/usr/sbin/reboot -f
```

**RHEL 7-9.0**:
```bash
# Boot parameter: rd.break
mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
chroot /sysroot
passwd
touch /.autorelabel
exit
exit
```
