| `sudo tcpdump -w capture.pcap` | Save to file for later analysis | For in-depth analysis or long-term capture |
| `sudo tcpdump -r capture.pcap` | Read from saved file | When analyzing previously captured data |

### Network Troubleshooting Scenarios

#### 1. Troubleshooting DNS Issues
```bash
# Capture DNS traffic
sudo tcpdump -i any port 53
```
**Scenario**: When users report they can't resolve domain names or DNS seems slow.

#### 2. Analyzing Web Server Traffic
```bash
# Capture HTTP/HTTPS traffic
sudo tcpdump -nn -i any port 80 or port 443
```
**Scenario**: Troubleshooting web server connectivity or performance issues.

#### 3. Investigating Connection Problems
```bash
# Capture TCP handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)
sudo tcpdump -i any 'tcp[tcpflags] & (tcp-syn|tcp-fin|tcp-rst) != 0'
```
**Scenario**: When applications report connection errors or timeouts.

#### 4. Monitoring Network Latency
```bash
# Capture ICMP ping traffic
sudo tcpdump -i any icmp
```
**Scenario**: When troubleshooting network latency or ping issues.

#### 5. Analyzing Network Congestion
```bash
# Capture traffic between specific hosts with packet sizes
sudo tcpdump -i any host 192.168.1.10 and host 192.168.1.20 -e
```
**Scenario**: When investigating bandwidth usage between specific devices.

### Security Monitoring Scenarios

#### 1. Detecting Port Scans
```bash
# Capture SYN packets (common in port scans)
sudo tcpdump -nn -i any 'tcp[tcpflags] & (tcp-syn) != 0 and not src net 192.168.0.0/24'
```
**Scenario**: When monitoring for potential reconnaissance activity from external networks.

#### 2. Identifying Suspicious Connections
```bash
# Monitor connections to unusual ports
sudo tcpdump -nn -i any 'tcp and (port 6667 or port 4444 or port 31337)'
```
**Scenario**: When looking for backdoor connections or command-and-control traffic.

#### 3. Detecting ARP Spoofing
```bash
# Monitor ARP traffic
sudo tcpdump -i any -n arp
```
**Scenario**: When suspicious of ARP poisoning attacks in your network.

### Complex Filtering Examples

#### 1. Traffic to/from Specific Networks
```bash
# Filter traffic to or from specific subnets
sudo tcpdump -i any net 192.168.1.0/24 and net 10.0.0.0/8
```
**Scenario**: When monitoring communication between different network segments.

#### 2. Advanced Protocol Filtering

```
**Scenario**: When troubleshooting TCP connection establishments or terminations.

#### 3. Application-Specific Traffic

# Capture database traffic
sudo tcpdump -i any 'port 3306 or port 5432 or port 1521'
```
**Scenario**: When troubleshooting database connectivity issues.

#### 4. Excluding Certain Traffic
```bash
# Capture everything except SSH and DNS
sudo tcpdump -i any 'not port 22 and not port 53'
```
**Scenario**: When trying to reduce noise in packet captures.

### Performance Optimization Techniques

#### 1. Using BPF for Efficient Filtering
```bash
# Using Berkeley Packet Filter syntax for efficient capture
sudo tcpdump -i any 'ip[9] = 6 and (tcp[13] & 0x03) != 0'
```
**Scenario**: For high-volume networks where efficient filtering is crucial.

#### 2. Capture with Buffer Size Adjustment
```bash
# Increase buffer size for busy networks
sudo tcpdump -i any -B 4096 -w capture.pcap
```
**Scenario**: When capturing on high-throughput networks to prevent packet loss.

#### 3. Time-Limited Captures
```bash
# Capture for a specific duration
sudo timeout 60s tcpdump -i any -w capture.pcap
```
**Scenario**: When you need to gather data for a specific timeframe.

## Important Notes

- **Root privileges required**: tcpdump typically requires administrator/root privileges to access network interfaces
- **Legal considerations**: Only capture traffic on networks you own or have explicit permission to monitor
- **Performance impact**: Packet capture can impact network performance on busy networks
- **Storage space**: Large captures can consume significant disk space
- **Filter complexity**: More complex filters may impact capture performance
- **Interpretation skills**: Understanding packet captures requires networking knowledge

## Practical Analysis Workflow

1. **Identify the issue** - Determine what problem you're trying to solve
2. **Choose capture points** - Select strategic network interfaces
3. **Create targeted filters** - Limit capture to relevant traffic
4. **Capture data** - Run tcpdump with appropriate options
5. **Analysis** - Examine captures directly or with tools like Wireshark
6. **Correlation** - Compare findings with system logs or other data
7. **Resolution** - Apply fixes based on analysis

## Combining With Other Tools

### Convert tcpdump captures for Wireshark analysis
```bash
# Capture and save in a format Wireshark can read
sudo tcpdump -i any -w capture.pcap port 80
```

### Use with grep for quick analysis
```bash
# Capture packets and pipe through grep
sudo tcpdump -l | grep "SYN"
```

### Automated monitoring with script
```bash
# Example of scripted monitoring
while true; do
  sudo tcpdump -nn -c 100 -i any 'tcp[tcpflags] & tcp-syn != 0' >> syn_log.txt
  sleep 60
done
```
